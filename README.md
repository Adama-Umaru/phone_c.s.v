This code reads the phone numbers from a text file named phone_numbers.txt using the read() method and splitting the lines into a list using splitlines(). It then writes the phone numbers to a CSV file named phone_numbers.csv using the csv.writer() method and the writerow() method to write each phone number as a row in the CSV file.

Note that the newline parameter is set to an empty string ("") to avoid adding extra newlines in the CSV file on different operating systems.

To run this code, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., phone_numbers_to_csv.py) and put the phone numbers in a text file named phone_numbers.txt in the same directory. Then you can run the script by opening a terminal in the directory and typing python phone_numbers_to_csv.py. The script will create a new CSV file named phone_numbers.csv with the phone numbers in the same directory.
